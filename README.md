## About the project

This is a simple project, it was developed with the purpose of learn and practice the React Basics.
It's based on a project used in a react course, I decided to create my own version of the course project.

It's is a rolodex that allows you to use a search bar to filter the Valorant Agents.

## Future improvements

What can be done to make it better?

- [ ] Change the components to functional components.
- [ ] Write tests to every single component.
- [ ] Create more pages and use the Valorant open API to show more data about the agents.
